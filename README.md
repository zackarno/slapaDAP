# slapaDAP
Designed to facilitate the development of reviewable Data Analysis Plans (DAP) and accelerate the transition to working mobile data collection tools (XLSForm). 
The framework is designed with a "DAP first" approach which is meant to emphasize the importance of having a strong data analysis plan prior to the coding of the mobile data collection tools. 

The functions are meant to speed up aspects of questionnaire design/tool development to provide researchers with more time to focus on building stronger research designs/data analysis plans.
